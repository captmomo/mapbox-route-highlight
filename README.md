## [Route planner with toilets](https://captmomo.github.io/mapbox-route-highlight/toilet/index.html)  

No more shitting your pants! :) Finally, a route planner which highlights the toilets along the route!
Always wanted to make something like this, so decided to try it out! Double click to set a point, only works for Singapore though.

kudos to cerivitos for the geojson; https://github.com/cerivitos/INeedToilet
